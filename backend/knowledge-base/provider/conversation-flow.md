# Provider Conversation Flow

## Overview
Guide providers (donors) through a friendly, efficient process to donate supplies during disasters.

## Conversation Objectives
1. Identify what supplies they have
2. Determine quantity and condition
3. Confirm their location
4. Assess transportation capability
5. Arrange delivery or pickup logistics

## Conversation Flow

### 1. Initial Greeting
- Thank them for their willingness to help
- Express how valuable their contribution is
- Ask what they would like to donate

**Example:**
> "Thank you so much for wanting to help! Your donation can make a real difference for families in need. What supplies do you have available to donate?"

### 2. Supply Identification
- Ask about the type of supplies
- Reference supply categories (water, food, medical, hygiene, etc.)
- Ask clarifying questions based on the category

**Key Questions:**
- "What type of supplies do you have?"
- "Can you describe them in more detail?"
- Use category-specific questions from supply-categories.json

### 3. Quantity Assessment
- Ask about quantities in measurable terms
- Examples: number of bottles, cases, boxes, pounds, items
- Help them estimate if they're unsure

**Example:**
> "About how many bottles of water do you have? If you're not sure, an estimate is fine - are we talking about a case or two, or several cases?"

### 4. Condition Verification
- Ensure items are suitable for donation
- Check expiration dates for food/medicine
- Confirm items are sealed/unopened when relevant
- Verify cleanliness for clothing/bedding

**Unsuitable Items:**
- Expired food or medications
- Opened/used hygiene products
- Damaged or dirty items
- Items that could pose safety risks

### 5. Location Information
- Ask for their location (city, neighborhood, or address)
- This helps match them with nearby distribution centers
- Be clear this is to coordinate logistics, not for public sharing

**Example:**
> "To help coordinate pickup or delivery, what area are you located in? Just a general area or zip code is fine."

### 6. Transportation Assessment
- Ask if they can deliver or need pickup
- If they can deliver, ask about vehicle type and capacity
- If pickup needed, note any access restrictions

**Key Questions:**
- "Are you able to deliver the supplies to a distribution center, or would you need us to arrange pickup?"
- "Do you have a vehicle available?"
- "Are there any access restrictions we should know about (stairs, gate code, etc.)?"

### 7. Availability & Timing
- Ask when the supplies are available
- Note any urgency (e.g., items about to expire)
- Coordinate pickup/delivery timeframe

**Example:**
> "When would be a good time to arrange pickup? Are the supplies available now, or is there a better time?"

### 8. Contact Confirmation
- Confirm their contact information
- Explain next steps
- Set expectations for response time

**Example:**
> "We have your contact information from your account. We'll connect you with a distribution center or someone in need within the next few hours. You'll receive a notification with details. Is there anything else you'd like to add about your donation?"

## Conversation Guidelines

### Tone & Approach
- **Grateful:** Always express appreciation
- **Efficient:** Keep questions focused and clear
- **Empathetic:** Recognize the effort they're making
- **Reassuring:** Explain the process clearly

### Pacing
- Ask 1-2 questions at a time
- Don't overwhelm with too many questions at once
- Allow them to provide additional information naturally

### Flexibility
- If they mention multiple supply types, address them one at a time
- If they're uncertain about details, help them estimate
- Adapt the conversation flow based on their responses

### Safety & Quality
- Politely decline unsuitable donations
- Explain why certain items can't be accepted
- Suggest alternatives when possible

**Example of Declining:**
> "I appreciate your offer of [item], but for safety reasons we can only accept [unopened/unexpired/etc.] items. Do you have any other supplies that might work?"

## Follow-up Actions
After gathering all information:
1. Summarize what they're donating
2. Confirm location and logistics
3. Explain matching process
4. Provide estimated timeline
5. Thank them again

**Example Summary:**
> "Perfect! So to summarize: you have 3 cases of bottled water and 10 cans of food, located in [area], and you're able to deliver them. We'll match you with a distribution center or someone in need and send you the details within a few hours. Thank you so much for your generosity!"

## Special Situations

### Large Donations
- For significant quantities, flag for special handling
- May need truck or multiple trips
- Coordinate directly with distribution centers

### Urgent/Perishable Items
- Items near expiration get priority matching
- Coordinate immediate pickup if needed

### Recurring Donors
- Thank them for continued support
- Streamline process if they've donated before
- Note any preferences from previous donations

## Red Flags
- Requests for payment or compensation
- Offers of inappropriate items (weapons, alcohol, etc.)
- Unusually aggressive or demanding behavior
- Suspicious requests for personal information

If red flags appear, politely end conversation and flag for review.
