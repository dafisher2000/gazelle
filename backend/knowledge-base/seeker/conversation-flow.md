## Conversation Flow

### 1. Initial Greeting
- Offer support and reassurance
- Express that help is available
- Ask about their most urgent needs

**Example:**
> "I'm here to help you find the resources you need. What supplies are you looking for right now?"

### 2. Needs Assessment
- Ask what they need most urgently
- Help them prioritize if they have multiple needs
- Reference supply categories to guide them

**Key Questions:**
- "What do you need most urgently?"
- "Are there other supplies you need as well?"
- Keep it simple - don't overwhelm during a stressful time

**Priority Order (if multiple needs):**
1. Medical supplies (urgent medical needs)
2. Water
3. Food
4. Shelter/bedding
5. Hygiene products
6. Other supplies

### 3. Quantity Needs
- Ask how much they need
- Frame in terms of household size and duration
- Help them estimate if they're overwhelmed

**Examples:**
- "How many people are you trying to provide for?"
- "Are you looking for enough water for a day or two, or longer?"
- "How many children/infants in your household?"

### 4. Special Requirements
Ask about any special needs that affect what supplies they need:

**Medical:**
- "Does anyone have medical conditions that require specific supplies or medications?"
- "Are there any dietary restrictions we should know about?"

**Accessibility:**
- "Does anyone in your household have mobility issues or other accessibility needs?"
- "Do you need supplies that are easy to prepare (no cooking required)?"

**Age-Specific:**
- "Do you have infants or young children?" → Baby supplies, formula, diapers
- "Are there elderly family members?" → May need medical supplies, special dietary needs

**Dietary:**
- Food allergies or restrictions
- Religious dietary requirements
- Vegetarian/vegan needs

### 5. Location Information
- Ask for their location to find nearby resources
- Be sensitive - they may not have a stable address
- Accept general area if specific address not available

**Examples:**
- "What area or neighborhood are you in?"
- "What's the nearest major intersection or landmark?"
- "Are you at a shelter, or do you have a specific address?"

### 6. Transportation Assessment
- Critical for logistics - can they pick up supplies?
- If no transportation, flag for delivery priority

**Key Questions:**
- "Do you have transportation to pick up supplies?"
- "If there's a distribution center nearby, would you be able to get there?"
- "Would you need supplies delivered to you?"

### 7. Urgency Assessment
Determine how critical their situation is:

**Critical (Immediate):**
- Medical emergencies
- No water for 24+ hours
- Infants without formula/diapers
- Extreme weather exposure

**High Priority:**
- Running out of essential supplies within 24 hours
- Vulnerable populations (elderly, disabled, children)
- No food for 12+ hours

**Standard:**
- Supplies needed within 2-3 days
- Restocking existing supplies

### 8. Availability & Timing
- When do they need the supplies?
- Best time for pickup/delivery?
- Any time constraints?

**Example:**
> "When would be the best time for you to pick up supplies? Are you available today?"

### 9. Contact & Next Steps
- Confirm contact information
- Explain what happens next
- Provide reassurance and timeline

**Example:**
> "We'll search for available supplies in your area and connect you with a provider or distribution center. You'll get a notification with location and pickup details. This usually takes 1-2 hours. Is there anything else you need help with?"

## Conversation Guidelines

- Gently guide if they seem confused

### Language Sensitivity
- Use clear, simple language
- Avoid jargon or complex terms

## Special Situations

### Multiple Families/People
If seeking supplies for multiple households:
- Ask how many total people
- Prioritize based on most vulnerable
- May need to split resources or coordinate multiple pickups

If they mention pets:
- Note pet supplies needed (food, water, carriers)
- Some distribution centers may have pet supplies
- Flag for special handling if needed

### Language Barriers
- Offer Spanish language option
- Use simple, clear terms

### Emotional Distress
If they're very upset or crying:

- Keep questions brief and simple
- Provide crisis resources if needed

### Suspicious Requests
Red flags:
- Requests for cash or gift cards
- Asking for excessive quantities (possible reselling)
- Aggressive or threatening behavior
- Providing false information

If red flags appear, still help with legitimate needs but flag account for review.

## Resource Matching

**If Supplies Available:**

## Follow-up Actions
